## Why We Need To Do This Manually

Roblox has implemented security measures that make automated group joining difficult:

- Captcha challenges during login
- Two-factor authentication requirements
- IP-based security checks
- Rate limiting on API requests

These security features help protect Roblox accounts from unauthorized access but make automation challenging without specialized tools.

## Next Steps After Joining

Once you've joined the group manually, return to the bot and use the verification features. The bot will be able to:

1. Verify your Roblox account is linked to your Discord
2. Check if you're a member of the USMC group
3. Assign appropriate Discord roles based on your verification status
